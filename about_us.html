<p>Jared is a mid 30's Network Engineer working for a local bank. He's married, has two kids and almost no freetime and wouldn't have it any other way. He enjoys watching sports, playing games (mostly RPGs and party games). Apparently he also loves spicy skittles.</p>

<h2>Mae</h2>

<p>Mae is a cognitive scientist by training who has decided to give this coding thing a spin. She also likes to draw and compose music in her free time.</p>

<h2>Nicole</h2>
<img src=./img/Nicole.jpg>
<p>Nicole is in her early 20's and is obsessed with her 4 cats. She does not leave the house unless there is a good reason and therefore has no social life.</p>

<h2>Erik</h2>
<img src=./img/Erik.png>
<p> Is a profressional homeless person, age is three pizzas and a half eaten pastrami. He used to live in a trash bin outside code fellows, but has recently upgraded to the recycle bin (Yeh yeeeeh). He currently lives with a rat (named Peter) and a cat made from leftover hostess cakes (named Richard). P.S. please throw your food in the recycle bin and make a wish. It won't come true, I'm just hungry.</p>
