#Color Game User Story

## As a user..

### As a user I want to play a color flipping / matching game
   The game should work and be fun!

### As a user I want want the rules / mechanics clearly explained to me
   A quick "how to play" body of text or even a video would be good.

### As a user I want some sort of scoring method so I can show off
  The score should be calculated in a way that is transparent and makes sense, it shouldn't be lost if I refresh or leave the page.

### As a user I want the game able to be randomized for replay value
  I don't want to be able to learn just a single pattern and win the game every time!

### As a user I want to get to know the team that made this amazing game
  With pictures please!

## As a developer ...

### As a developer I want to make a well designed color flipping game
  The mechanics of the game should be simple and easy to understand but should still be challenging enough to be fun

### As a developer I want the site to be well styled
  The website should be sleek, there should be nice animations or transitions when playing the game.

### As a developer I the user to be able to save their game to finish later
  The game should save it's state but there should be an option to both randomize and reset.

### As a developer I want the website to be easily navigatible
  The site should be layed out in an orderly intuitive fashion.

### As a developer I want the user to be able to contact us with comments
  Hopefully they'll provide us with bug reports and comments to improve!

### As a developer I want to keep track of scoring metrics
  Score could be based off number of clicks, the time it took to solve or some combination of either.
